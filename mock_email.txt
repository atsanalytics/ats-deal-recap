Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out about the crude oil opportunity. We're definitely interested in discussing this further.

Regarding the 500,000 BBL Brent Dated cargo you mentioned, we can work with that volume. However, I'd like to clarify a few points:

1. Laycan period - you mentioned March 15-20, 2024. Is this firm or can we discuss a slightly wider window?
2. Pricing - I understand you're looking at Brent Dated + $0.50/bbl. Given current market conditions, we might need to adjust this differential.
3. Delivery terms - FOB Rotterdam works for us, but we need to confirm the vessel details.

Our crude desk is ready to move forward once we align on these key terms. Can we schedule a call this afternoon to discuss?

Hi John,

Thanks for your quick response. I'm glad ATS is interested in this opportunity.

To address your questions:

1. Laycan: March 15-20 is our preferred window, but we can extend to March 15-25 if needed. The vessel "Shell Navigator" is scheduled to load during this period.

2. Pricing: Brent Dated + $0.50/bbl is our current offer. However, I can discuss with my manager about a slight adjustment if we can finalize the deal today. What differential would work for ATS?

3. Vessel: "Shell Navigator" - 300,000 DWT VLCC, built 2018, last inspection by SGS in December 2023. All certificates are valid.

Additional details:
- Product: Brent Dated crude oil
- Volume: 500,000 BBL
- Quality: Standard Brent specification
- Inspection: SGS (as per standard Shell practice)
- Incoterms: FOB Rotterdam
- Payment: 30 days from B/L date

I'm available for a call at 2:00 PM GMT today. Does that work for you?

Hi Sarah,

Perfect, 2:00 PM GMT works for me. I'll call you on your direct line.

Based on our internal analysis, we can accept Brent Dated + $0.45/bbl. This reflects current market conditions and our risk assessment for this volume.

A few additional points to confirm:
- Vessel details look good, "Shell Navigator" is acceptable
- SGS inspection is fine with us
- 30-day payment terms are standard for us
- We'll need the full cargo specification sheet by close of business today

If we can agree on the $0.45/bbl differential, I believe we have a deal. Our legal team can prepare the contract for your review by tomorrow morning.

Looking forward to our call.

Best regards,
John
