        "conversation": "John Smith (ATS Crude Desk-john.smith@ats.com): Hi Sarah, I hope you're doing well. I wanted to discuss a potential crude oil deal with you.\n\nSarah Johnson (Shell Trading-sarah.johnson@shell.com): Hello John! Yes, I'm doing great, thank you. I'm definitely interested in hearing about this crude opportunity. What do you have in mind?\n\nJohn Smith (ATS Crude Desk-john.smith@ats.com): We're looking to sell 10,000 barrels of Basrah Light crude. The laycan would be January 15-17, 2025, FOB Basrah. We have the vessel \"Tanker Alpha\" ready for loading.\n\nSarah Johnson (Shell Trading-sarah.johnson@shell.com): That sounds interesting. What's your pricing basis? Are you looking at dated Brent or Dubai?\n\nJohn Smith (ATS Crude Desk-john.smith@ats.com): We're pricing against dated Brent. We're looking for a premium of $0.25 per barrel above dated Brent for the January 14-16 pricing window.\n\nSarah Johnson (Shell Trading-sarah.johnson@shell.com): That's a bit high for current market conditions. We typically see Basrah Light trading at dated Brent flat or even at a small discount. Would you consider dated Brent flat?\n\nJohn Smith (ATS Crude Desk-john.smith@ats.com): I understand the market is soft, but we have good quality crude and the laycan timing works well. What if we meet in the middle at dated Brent plus $0.15?\n\nSarah Johnson (Shell Trading-sarah.johnson@shell.com): That's more reasonable. Let me check with our team. What about the inspection? We'll need SGS to do the quality inspection.\n\nJohn Smith (ATS Crude Desk-john.smith@ats.com): Absolutely, SGS inspection is standard for us. They're already scheduled for the loading window. The vessel will be at berth 3 in Basrah port.\n\nSarah Johnson (Shell Trading-sarah.johnson@shell.com): Perfect. And what about the payment terms? We're looking at 30 days from B/L date.\n\nJohn Smith (ATS Crude Desk-john.smith@ats.com): That works for us. Standard 30-day payment terms in USD. Do you have any other questions about the cargo?\n\nSarah Johnson (Shell Trading-sarah.johnson@shell.com): Just to confirm - this is 10,000 barrels of Basrah Light, FOB Basrah, dated Brent plus $0.15, laycan January 15-17, 2025, with SGS inspection?\n\nJohn Smith (ATS Crude Desk-john.smith@ats.com): Exactly. The vessel \"Tanker Alpha\" will load at berth 3, Basrah port. Price window is January 14-16 for the dated Brent reference.\n\nSarah Johnson (Shell Trading-sarah.johnson@shell.com): Great! I'll need to get final approval from our management, but this looks good to me. Can you send me the formal offer by end of day?\n\nJohn Smith (ATS Crude Desk-john.smith@ats.com): Absolutely, I'll prepare the formal offer and send it to you by 5 PM today. Thanks for the quick discussion, Sarah.\n\nSarah Johnson (Shell Trading-sarah.johnson@shell.com): Perfect, John. I'll review it and get back to you tomorrow morning. Have a great day!\n\nJohn Smith (ATS Crude Desk-john.smith@ats.com): You too, Sarah. Talk to you tomorrow!"
